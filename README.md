# Miata Digital Dash Project
## This page is built to document the process of building my Raspberry Pi powered digital dashboard in my Turbocharged 1999 Mazda Miata.

My goal was to create a display to monitor coolant temp and boost levels on my car without cluttering the interior up with lots of gauges. Since the car is already running on a Megasquirt 3 ECU, sensors already exist for most of the values that I would want to monitor. Because I was going to run a digital display, I also wanted to be able to make basic tuning adjustments to the car without requiring a laptop with me at all times.

Knowing that I want the ability to perform changes to the tune without a laptop, the two options I was considering were either a tablet or a Raspberry Pi based setup. I wasn't happy with any of the mounting solutions that I'd found for tablets, and was worried about the hardware performance compared to a Pi. Once I settled on a Raspberry Pi 4, it was time to choose the rest of the hardware involved.
