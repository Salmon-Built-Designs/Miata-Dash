# Miata Dash Project
## This page is built to document the process of building my Raspberry Pi powered dashboard in my 1999 Mazda Miata.
My goal was to create a display to monitor coolant temp and boost levels on my Miata without cluttering the interior up with lots of gauges. Since the car is already running on a Megasquirt 3 ECU, it already knows most of the values that I would want to monitor. Since I was going to run a digital display anyway, I wanted to also be able to make tuning adjustments to the car without requiring a laptop with me at all times. 

Knowing that I wanted to be able to perform some basic tuning changes in the car without a laptop, the options I was considering were either a tablet or a Raspberry Pi based setup. I wasn't happy with any of the mounting solutions that I'd found for tablets, and was worried about the hardware performance compared to a Pi.
